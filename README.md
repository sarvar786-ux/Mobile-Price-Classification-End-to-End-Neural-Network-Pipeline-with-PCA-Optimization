# 📱 Mobile Price Classification  
### End-to-End Neural Network Pipeline with PCA Optimization

This project focuses on building an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** to classify mobile phones into different **price ranges** based on their hardware and feature specifications. A **Neural Network model** is trained with **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** to reduce dimensionality and improve efficiency and performance.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Mobile phone pricing depends on multiple factors such as RAM, battery power, camera quality, internal storage, and connectivity features. This project uses a **supervised learning approach** to predict the **price category** of a mobile device rather than the exact price.

The pipeline includes:
- Data preprocessing  
- Feature scaling  
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA  
- Neural Network model training  
- Performance evaluation
